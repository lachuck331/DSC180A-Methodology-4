B14, Meftah Ilyes

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
Probably vulnarability and loss modelling for disasters using historical data.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
Using Agentic techniques on Geospacial catastrophe data and seeing if we can make useful models.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
Right now we are training a model and then testing it on a very specific case, Id like to make some sort of interface where the model could be used for other locations.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I'd like to make use of DSMLP but right now the data we are using does not neccesitate it.
